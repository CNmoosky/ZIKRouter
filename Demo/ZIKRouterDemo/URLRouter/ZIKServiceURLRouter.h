/**
 A URL router to search and call service from url.
 
 It's easy to add other custom features with a custom URL router parent class, such as:
 
 1. Call any methods of destination via url. the URL router can get parameters and call methods with OC runtime: router://loginService/?action=callMethod&method=fillAccount&account=abc
 
 2. Automatically give data back to h5 after performing action. If you are using JavaScriptBridge, the you can pass the `responseCallback` to router's userInfo and call it after performing action.
 
 You can implement these features by yourself if needed.
